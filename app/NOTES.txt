what is web rtc?
    JS apis that allow us to establish peer to peer connections between two browsers to echange voice and video data

NOT THE SAME AS WEBSOCKETS

websockets are peer to server
    affan sends server message, message sends message to bun

rtc is peer to peer
    affan sends message directly to bun



DIFFERENCES

    Web rtc uses UDP protocol
        - UDP not reliable for important data
        - no built in signaling

    websockets are a WSS protocol




SDP 
    session description protocol    - object containing metadata of the session connection

ICE canidates
    public ip address and port that recieve data
    
    STUN servers that are routing our data for the connection rather than the device themselves routing the rtc data
        ie: google STUN server

    TRICKLING ICE 
        sends over ICE canidates to peers as they are generated rather than a batch sent with the SDP


SIGNALING 
    peer sends SDP to server to establish connection with another peer. the other peer then sends his SDP back to the server who sends it to init peer. Now they establish an RTC

    init peer asks STUN server "whats my ip address"
        STUN replies and sends over to peer to the ICE ip address
        peer 2 will do the same


    You can use Agora api as a signaling server but you could also use a python server to do the work for you.
